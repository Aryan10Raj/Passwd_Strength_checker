 Password Strength Assessment Tool

This Python script evaluates the strength of a password based on various criteria such as length, the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, special characters, and whether the password is susceptible to dictionary attacks or contains easily guessable patterns.

## Features

- **Length Check**: Ensures the password is at least 8 characters long.
- **Character Variety Check**: Verifies the inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- **Dictionary Attack Prevention**: Checks if the password is a commonly used password from a predefined list.
- **Pattern Detection**: Detects sequences, repeated characters, and common keyboard patterns.
